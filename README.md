# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to update a website to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The user will be able to filter information by date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
To perform a search, the user needs to look at the bottom left hand corner of the webpage. Then the user can choose how they want to filter the information they want to recieve (by date, city, state, country, or shape). The user can also select multiple criteria to get a more restricted search. Then when the user wants to clear their search they can click UFO Sightings in the top left hand corner to refresh the page.

## Summary
One drawback of this new design is the user cannot filter for duration or comments. This would be helpful if they knew a specific fact about the event but did not necessarily know where the sighting happened. Therefore another update that could be made would be to add a filter for duration and a filter for comments. One other update that would be beneficial would be to add a display for no search results if no data was found according to their search filter criteria.
